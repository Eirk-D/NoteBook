Purity
What makes RxJS powerful is its ability to produce values using pure functions. That means your code is less prone to errors.

Normally you would create an impure function, where other pieces of your code can mess up your state.

Flow
RxJS has a whole range of operators that helps you control how the events flow through your observables.

Other flow control operators are filter, delay, debounceTime, take, takeUntil, distinct, distinctUntilChanged etc.

Values
You can transform the values passed through your observables.
